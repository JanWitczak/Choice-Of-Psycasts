# Choice of Psycasts

This is a mod for game Rimworld.

## Description
Allows manual selection of psycasts gained when increasing psylink level.

When a pawn gains a psylink level, either by linking with Anima tree, during a bestowing ceremony or by using Psylink neuroformer instead of gaining a random psycast, you will be allowed to choose the gained psycast. The list of available psycasts is generated on startup and as such this mod is implicitly compatible with any mod adding new psycasts.

- You can configure the mod to be presented a choice from between 2 to 5 psycasts if you prefer to preserve some randomness.
- You can configure the number of psycast picks on increasing psylink level.
- You can configure the number of psycast picks of previous level on increasing psylink level.

## Compatibility
- The mod should be compatible with any mod adding new psycasts.
- The mod should be compatible with any mod adding new playable races.
- The Mod is **not** compatibile with Vanilla Psycasts Expanded.

## Savefile safety
You add the mod mid game with no issues, or remove it without fearing corrupting the game provided no pawns have a pending choice. If you were to remove the mod without choosing a psycast you would just lose the option and not be refunded a psycast for that level.
